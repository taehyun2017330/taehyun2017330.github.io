    detail: >
      <p>As AI auditing in hiring processes gains importance, New York City now requires companies to audit their AI systems for bias. However, the novelty of this requirement has led to several challenges, including loopholes and employee resistance, stemming largely from the autonomy companies have to self-audit and report results.<br></p>
    
      <p>My research investigates the perspectives of lawmakers, managers, and AI system builders on AI auditing in HR. I aim to enhance trust in these systems by improving transparency, interpretability, privacy, and by adding human intervention into the algorithms. This relatively unexplored area offers a significant opportunity for impactful research.<br></p>
    
      <p>Currently discussing opportunities with several professors in the intersection of HCI, Business, and Law.</p>

      <p>This project attempts to enhancing human task performance in performing clustering tasks by addressing the perceptual biases introduced by variations in scatterplot sizes. It started with my personal goal to reduce bias and help people create more accurate decision-making based on visual data interpretation.<br></p>

      <p>The project'sapproach involved conducting user studies that compared various scatterplot sizes and their effects on clustering assignments. I discovered that larger scatterplot sizes tend to make cluster assignments appear more granular, while smaller sizes often result in a coarser clustering perception. This observation led to the development of strategies to mitigate perceptual biases introduced by geometric scaling.<br></p>

      <p>To address these biases, I created a model to offset the influence of plot size on cluster recognition. Additionally, I developed a system that automatically adjusts scatterplot and point sizes to maintain consistent cluster granularity across different viewing conditions.<br></p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advised by <a href="http://hcil.snu.ac.kr/people/jinwook-seo" target="_blank">Jinwook Seo</a> presented these findings and the methods for countering bias in visual data interpretation at K-Vis 2023. The solutions proposed have been further detailed as a paper submission, where we outline how to maintain consistent data interpretation in different screen displays.</span></p>

      <p>Question, Answer, and Connect began with personal frustrations regarding how Q&A massive group chats used in courses were extremely uncomfortable. Our initial low-fidelity demo, using Piazza-style bullet-type Q&A boards, revealed that more people preferred real-time chats. To address the problem of asynchronous, untimely, and repetitive questions, we aimed to maintain the real-time, convenient format of chatrooms while solving these issues. <br></p>

This system employs micro-role hierarchies to enable novices to make meaningful contributions to real-world projects. By dividing complex tasks into manageable micro-roles, we facilitate a learning process that allows novices to contribute to ongoing projects without having to go through the initial tutorials, which can often lead to boredom, fatigue, and loss of passion, as well as unnecessary time and overhead.<br></p>

My responsibilities were to lead the development and integration of <span style="font-weight: bold;">micro-role hierarchies</span> within the Causeway platform, enhancing its capability to support web development education through structured, real-world contributions. To test this system for an actual user study, I had to conduct proto studies, interviews, and thematic analysis to explore how we can encourage novices to contribute while learning. This project not only highlighted the potential of micro-role hierarchies to transform educational approaches in technical fields but also reinforced the importance of practical experience in learning environments.<br></p>

      <p>FashionAlign is a new AI system to guide the way novice users search for fashion items by bridging the gap between abstract style descriptions and practical search capabilities. Utilizing natural language processing and advanced visualization techniques, the system transforms vague style inputs into a curated visual display of fashion items, significantly improving the search experience. This approach allows users to search using intuitive, everyday language, aligning textual descriptions with visual features to ensure that results closely match user queries. The system's use of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction facilitates an organized and visually appealing presentation of search results. Designed with a focus on user-centric principles, FashionAlign has demonstrated improved match accuracy and query refinement in user studies, making it a valuable tool for simplifying the fashion search process.</p>

This approach not only provides insights into the data integrity after projection but also helps in assessing the trustworthiness of the multidimensional projection.

      <p>In the project "Modeling Character Interactions Using Graph Theory Analysis," I applied graph theory—originally learned through analyzing social networks on Twitter—to explore the intricate character dynamics in "Les Misérables." Known for its complex and lengthy character interactions, this classic novel provided a rich field for examining how fictional relationships can be systematically mapped and understood. Employing graph theory metrics such as closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality, I was able to identify key characters like Jean Valjean, Marius, and Gavroche, highlighting their crucial roles in connecting and influencing the story's development. This analysis delineated distinct communities within the narrative, such as revolutionary students and authority figures, showcasing how various character groups contribute to the novel's elaborate social dynamics. Through this comprehensive network analysis, I gained deep insights into the structural and thematic components of the narrative, significantly enhancing the understanding of character influence and community interactions within the text. This project demonstrates the utility of graph theory as a powerful tool for unraveling and understanding key interactions in any fictional work, opening avenues for deeper literary analysis and interpretation.</p>
