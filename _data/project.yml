      <p>In our research paper on conversational LLM agents, we focused on developing a scalable and accurate LLM Taxonomy Classifier to analyze a large corpus of real and lab conversational data. The project involved iteratively designing and refining a GPT-4 based classifier to automatically categorize each conversational tuple according to our taxonomy, which was derived from existing qualitative coding practices with LLMs. We aimed to optimize the classifier for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and efficiency. Initial versions tested against manually coded data revealed gaps, which led us to expand our taxonomy to include overlooked conversational elements like casual chatting. To improve accuracy, we refined taxonomy definitions, prioritized classification types, and utilized few-shot learning with precisely chosen examples to correct frequent misclassifications. Efficiency was enhanced by optimizing prompt lengths and eliminating non-essential elements, ensuring the classifier was suitable for large-scale applications. The refined classifier underwent rigorous testing to confirm its effectiveness, comparing its performance to human-labeled data with a focus on user motivations and patterns of follow-up queries. The final system achieved substantial accuracies of 74.39% and 71.11% in these areas, respectively. This project not only advanced our understanding of LLM-based conversation analysis but also demonstrated the potential of machine learning in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of qualitative research tools.</p>
