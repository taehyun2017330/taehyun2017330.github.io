Hi! I am a prospective graduate student at Seoul National University, advised by **Jinwook Seo**. Before SNU, I was a research intern at **KAIST KIXLAB**, advised by **Juho Kim**, and at **UCSC Tech4Good Lab**, advised by **David Kim**.

My current research focuses on **Human-AI Interaction**, including but not limited to:

1. **Intent** â€“ Investigating multi-turn interactions in LLMs to better identify user intent in long-form dialogue.
2. **Influence** â€“ Exploring how language in foundational models shapes public perception and decision-making.
3. **Scalability** â€“ Leveraging crowd intelligence to audit and improve efficiency in AI-driven mass decision systems.
