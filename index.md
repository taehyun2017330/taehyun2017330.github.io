  I'm passionate about creating meaningful interactions between humans and computers and exploring human behavior. My academic journey in **Computer Science and Engineering** has given me interest for **Data Visualization**, **Social Computing**, and **System Building**
  
  Previously, my research was centered on aiding decision-making in data visualization tasks. <strong>Currently, I am focused on helping humans perform better in two new tasks:</strong>
  
  1. <a href="javascript:showContent('projects');" class="nav-link">**Human-AI Interaction**: Enhancing decision-making processes in AI auditing systems to aid policymakers in making reliable decisions.</a>
  2. <a href="javascript:showContent('projects');" class="nav-link">**Improving Learning Outcomes in Large-Group Settings**: Helping students and TAs learn and teach better in asynchronous environments.</a>
