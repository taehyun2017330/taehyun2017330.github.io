  <h1 align="center">Hey there, I'm Taehyun Yang! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p align="center">
    ðŸ“š Undergraduate Student studying Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) and Business Administration (BA) at <strong>Seoul National University</strong>. Previously majored in Computer Engineering at<strong> UIUC</strong>
  </p>
  I am passionate about identifying unexplored connections within human-computer interactions, moving beyond user-centered design to a more comprehensive **stakeholder-centered** approach. My academic background in CSE and BA has equipped me with skillsets such as **Data Visualization**, **Social Computing**, and **System Building**, enabling me to explore and build solutions that enhance these interactions.
  
  Previously, my research was centered on aiding decision-making in data visualization tasks. <strong>Currently, I am focused on exploring unfounded interactions and creating stakeholder-centered systems in two areas:</strong>

  2. <a href="javascript:showContent('projects');" class="nav-link">**Improving Learning Outcomes in Large-Group Settings**: Helping Students Learn and TAs Teach Better in Asynchronous Environments</a>
