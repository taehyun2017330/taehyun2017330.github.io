  <p align="center">
    ðŸ“š Undergraduate Student studying Computer Science & Engineering and Business Administration at <strong>Seoul National University</strong>. Previously majored in Computer Engineering at<strong> UIUC</strong>
  </p>
  I'm passionate about creating meaningful interactions between humans and computers and exploring human behavior. My academic journey in **Computer Science and Engineering** has given me interest for **Data Visualization**, **Social Computing**, and **System Building**
  
  Currently I am focused on two main topics:
  
  1. **Exploring Human - AI interaction** to improve decision making in AI auditing systems and help policy makers make reliable decisions.
  2. **Enhancing the management of mass group chats** in educational and large group settings by addressing the challenges of asynchronous communication.
