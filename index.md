Hi! I am an upcoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Maryland, advised by **Fumeng Yang**. Before UMD, I was a research intern at **SNU HCIL** - advised by **Jinwook Seo** and **KAIST KIXLAB** - advised by **Juho Kim**.

My current research focuses on **Human-AI Interaction**, including but not limited to:

1. **Intent** â€“ Investigating multi-turn interactions in LLMs to better identify user intent in long-form dialogue.
2. **Influence** â€“ Exploring how language in foundational models shapes public perception and decision-making.
3. **Scalability** â€“ Leveraging crowd intelligence to audit and improve efficiency in AI-driven mass decision systems.
